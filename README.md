## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd developer2u
   ```

2. **Deploy with the deployment script (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   *This script tries docker-compose first, then falls back to manual Docker commands if needed.*

3. **Or use manual Docker build (Most Reliable)**
   ```bash
   sudo docker build -t developer2u .
   sudo docker run -d -p 7702:7702 --name developer2u-website --restart unless-stopped developer2u
   ```

4. **Or try Docker Compose (if compatible)**
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7702`

### Manual Docker Build (Alternative Method)

```bash
# Build the Docker image
sudo docker build -t developer2u .

# Run the container
sudo docker run -d -p 7702:7702 --name developer2u-website --restart unless-stopped developer2u

# Check status
sudo docker ps

# View logs
sudo docker logs -f developer2u-website
```

### Docker Configuration

- **Port**: 7702 (configurable)
- **Web Server**: Nginx Alpine
- **Build Process**: Multi-stage build for optimized image size
- **Features**: Gzip compression, security headers, static asset caching
